# CM3-CS-1
My name is Madhav Arora. I am currently pursuing BBA from Hult International Business School, Boston. 
As a part of my curriculum, I am studying Core Module 3 (CM3) in Hult as of now.
My favorite hobbies include playing golf, reading business related books, go karting.
I am really excited to learn about programming languages such as python, and SQL and become a research analyst.
